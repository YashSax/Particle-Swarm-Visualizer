<h2>What is Particle Swarm Optimization?</h2>
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a bio-inspired machine learning algorithm that optimizes solutions to a problem by iteratively updating many candidate solutions, or particles, over time. <br></br>

PSO, because it was initially intented to simulate social behavior, exhibits behavior strinkingly similar to that of a flock of birds or a school of fish. The main benefits of using PSO include the ability to have a non-differentiable error function (unlike gradient descent) and the ability to easily parallelize.<br></br>
